## Intro Badges&#x20;

Imagine you're in a new school or a club where everyone is starting from scratch, but you can earn stars or pins for being awesome at something. That's what badges are like in Honey Chat.

## Two Primary Roles of Badges

Showing Off and Establishing Reputation

* Badges serve as your digital accolades, showcasing your expertise, and contributions to the app. They're your way of saying, "Look at what I've achieved," making it easier for others to see your value at a glance. If you claim to be a "whale" in the community, your badges can back that up.
* Trust Verification: When someone is doing due diligence to see if they can trust you, badges provide another layer of credibility.&#x20;

### Path to Beradrop

* Each badge you earn isn't just for show, it comes with points that count towards our Beradrop. The more badges you earn, the more points you accumulate, moving you closer to rewards and exclusive access. It's like collecting stars where each one brings you closer to a prize, linking your community contributions directly to tangible benefits.
