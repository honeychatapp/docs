# ðŸš€ Points Overview

## Badges (Majority of Points)

The primary way to earn airdrop points is through earning badges within the app. These are special recognitions or achievements that you can acquire by participating in various activities on Honey Chat. \
The more badges you collect, the more points you accumulate in the airdrop. This method ensures that everyone has a fair chance to earn rewards based on their level of engagement and participation.

## Leaderboard Placement (Minority of Points)

A smaller share of the total points in the airdrop is distributed according to your ranking on our [leaderboard](leaderboard.md). Although fewer points are allocated to these positions overall, there will be fewer recipients, which increases the advantage for those who actively compete.

## Bonuses

Keep an eye out for special tasks and quests like the [community badges](badges/community-badges.md). These activities unlock Unique Modifier Badges - with unique enhancements that don't award points directly. Instead, Modifiers multiply or alter your existing base points, potentially boosting your score significantly. \
