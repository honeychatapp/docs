# Create your Access Pass

**Step 1:** Begin by opening the Honey Chat app and navigating to your profile page. \
**Step 2:** Once in your profile, find and click the "Buy" button. This action initiates the process of purchasing the initial access passes for your chatroom.\
**Step 3:** You'll be guided through a setup process. Select a bonding curve that aligns with your chatroom's goals and audience expectations. Each curve impacts how your passes are priced on the market.\
Step 4: Decide how many initial passes you want to buy. This decision affects the initial liquidity and potential growth of your chatroom.\
Step 5: Finalize your purchase by completing the transaction. This step will mint your chatroom passes on the Berachain blockchain.\
Step 6: With your chatroom, you can now share your unique chatroom with others. This not only invites people to join your community but also allows them to buy, sell, or short your passes on the open market.
