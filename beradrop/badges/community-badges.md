# Community Badges

In Honey Chat, unique community badges allow you to display your affiliation with a specific community within the app. \
\
Each unique community badge also acts as a points multiplier, giving you a boost to your base points in the Beradrop system. By earning these badges you not only showcase your community pride but also enhance your rewards.
