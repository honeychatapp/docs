# Unique Community Badges

In Honey Chat, unique community badges allow you to display your affiliation with a specific community within the app. Theyâ€™re your way to show off which group resonates with you the most and highlight your role in the Berachain ecosystem. \
\
Each unique community badge also acts as a points modifier, giving you a boost to your base points in the Beradrop system. By earning these badges you not only showcase your community pride but also enhance your rewards, helping you gain exclusive perks and recognition.
