# Fee Model Overview

League.Tech employs a transparent and flexible fee model to ensure fairness and sustainability within the ecosystem. The current fee structure is as follows:

### Pass Trading Fees

* **Platform Fee (Creator Fee):** 7% of the transaction amount is directed to the platform. This fee contributes to the ongoing development and maintenance of League.Tech, ensuring a robust and innovative social networking experience.
* **Share Owner Fee:** Pass owners, receive 2% of the total transaction amount. This incentivizes pass ownership and provides a direct benefit to the community members contributing to the platform's growth.
* **Referrer Fee:** Referrers receive 1% of the transaction amount. This referral fee is designed to reward users who introduce new members to the League.Tech community, fostering organic growth.

**Total Fee:** The cumulative effect of the platform fee, share owner fee, and referrer fee results in a 10% fee on all transactions within the League.Tech ecosystem. It's important to note that liquidation transactions, performed as a service for the platform, do not incur any fees for the liquidator.

### **Subscription Model:**

Subscriptions have a default length of 30 days, with a starting price set at 1 METIS.

**Platform Fee (Creator Fee):** 10% of the transaction amount is directed to the platform.&#x20;

**Share Owner Fee:** Pass owners, receive 2% of the total transaction amount. This incentivizes pass ownership and provides a direct benefit to the community members contributing to the platform's growth.

All these parameters are dynamic and can be updated, ensuring adaptability to changing market conditions and user preferences.



**Tipping Mechanism:** Tipping operates outside the smart contract, involving a simple Metis.transfer call. The transaction is then indexed in the League.Tech database, associating the transfer with a specific Post or Comment. While not governed by the smart contract, tipping enhances user engagement and content appreciation, contributing to a vibrant and supportive community.

**Reputation System:** badges transition into airdrop points, offering creators diverse avenues for monetization. This decentralized model diverges from traditional platforms by providing creators with unlimited earnings potential tied to community growth, albeit with inherent risks tied to content quality fluctuations.
