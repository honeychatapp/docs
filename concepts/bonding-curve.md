# Passes Bonding Curve

League.Tech employs a bonding curve to determine pass prices, acting as a mathematical formula governing token price changes. The bonding curve connects the creation of new passes with the cryptocurrency 'bonded' or put into the system.&#x20;

The bonding curve formula for pass prices when buying: y = (x²) / 16000 Where ‘y’ is the pass price, measured in METIS units, and ‘x’ is the total pass circulation (x increases when people buy and decreases when people sell).&#x20;

For pass prices when selling, the formula is slightly different: y = (x - 1)² / 16000&#x20;

e.g., let’s say Amber buys a pass from someone who has five pass holders. The purchase price for such a pass with five holders is 0.00156 + 10% fee = 0.00171 METIS. Let’s say Amber wants to resell the pass when that person has 10 holders. The selling price would be 0.00506 – 10% fee = 0.00455 METIS. Therefore, Amber’s profit would be 0.00455 – 0.00171 = 0.00279 METIS.

The trading fee of 10% is incorporated into the price during trades. The quadratic shape of League.Tech's bonding curve encourages early adoption and investment, favoring lower prices for early investors. However, by introducing pass shorting and tiered access with subscriptions, League.Tech addresses criticisms within the space, specifically concerns about the pass price becoming too high as popular creators' chat rooms attract more followers. This multifaceted approach ensures a more inclusive and sustainable model, countering the perception of benefits being limited to early adopters

## Price Dynamics in League.Tech

The relationship between price and supply in League.Tech is governed by a bonding curve equation that dynamically determines the pass price based on its supply. As the user base engages in buying passes, the price of each new pass rises in response to the bonding curve equation. Conversely, should users decide to sell their passes, the price experiences a decrease.

### Pass Transactions in League.Tech

#### Buying Passes:

When users aim to acquire a pass, such as one associated with a content creator, the METIS price is calculated by considering the current supply and the bonding curve equation. The buyer, upon completing the transaction, receives passes, contributing to an increase in the total supply of passes.

#### Selling Passes:

For users opting to sell their passes, the METIS they receive is determined by the current supply and the bonding curve equation. The seller obtains METIS, resulting in a decrease in the overall supply of passes.

#### Shorting Passes in League.Tech:

League.Tech introduces an innovative feature—Shorting Passes without the need for a counterparty. Users can engage in pass shorting by taking speculative positions on the anticipated decrease in pass prices. This feature allows users to benefit from market dynamics even when predicting a decline in pass prices, providing a unique avenue for active participation within the League.Tech ecosystem.
