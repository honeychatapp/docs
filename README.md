# League Tech Introduction

## Introduction

League.Tech - SocialFi built right.

A pioneering decentralized social networking and finance application developed on the Metis blockchain, functioning as a Layer-2 blockchain for Ethereum. This innovative platform establishes connections between content creators, encompassing influencers, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), celebrities, and their audiences using distinctive social tokens referred to as “**Passes**” within the League.Tech app.

League.Tech ensures every user is equipped with a pass, enabling them to seamlessly transition between content creators and consumers. Individuals acquiring a creator's pass unlock exclusive privileges, gaining entry to private chat rooms for one-to-many conversations, exclusive content, and other perks tailored by each creator. As social tokens are intricately linked to the creator's profile, these passes undergo price fluctuations reflective of the community's strength.

Comparisons between League.Tech and traditional Web2 social media platforms underscore the platform's commitment to liberating creators' earning potential from platform constraints. As a creator's popularity grows, the creator and their pass-holding fans can reap economic benefits from this organic growth.

League.Tech introduces a distinctive model that intertwines the fates of creators and pass owners more closely. It establishes pathways for both parties to receive rewards for growth. For users reluctant to purchase a pass upfront, an alternative subscription model allows them to subscribe to the content creator, granting access to an exclusive feed of posts. This multi-layered access structure provides three distinct tiers for any participant within the League.Tech platform.

In addition to this, League.Tech pioneers the concept of collaborative content creation within “**Leagues**”. Leagues represent groups of KOLs collaborating to provide unique, diverse, and engaging content to their shared audience. This innovative approach fosters a sense of community and mutual support among creators within the League.Tech platform, enhancing the overall user experience.\
