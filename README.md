## What is SocialFi?&#x20;

SocialFi represents a convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) principles with the dynamics of social media.&#x20;

Operating on the premise of allowing users to monetize their interactions. Content creators can directly engage with their audience without intermediaries, marking a departure from the traditional social media model. Unique elements such as digital ownership through NFTs and DAOs for governance further enhance the experience.

Most SocialFi projects enable creators to capitalize on their content through social tokens attached to a bonding curve, with a percentage of trading fees going to the content creator. Within Honey Chat, these are referred to as Access Passes, providing full access to a creator's content.

## Why do we need it?&#x20;

Social media has revolutionized how we communicate, share, and monetize our interactions. However, current Web2 platforms fail to truly empower individuals. They centralize control, dilute individual brand value, and raise concerns about censorship, privacy, and data monetization.

Enter SocialFi, deeply rooted in the core principles of Web3. It revolutionizes online social interactions by introducing social tokens tied to individual brand value. No longer are users passive participants in a platform's revenue model; instead, they can tangibly monetize their influence, engagements, and content. This tokenization shifts the balance of power, placing control and value in the hands of individual contributors rather than centralized entities. With social tokens, your "Social Capital" is no longer an abstract metric but something tangible that you can calculate and leverage.

SocialFi provides a more equitable, transparent, and empowering social ecosystem where individuals are recognized, rewarded, and have agency over their online presence and interactions.
