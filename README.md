# ðŸ¤¯ Introducing League.Tech

League.Tech is a decentralized social networking and finance (SocialFi) application. The free-to-join platform liberates content creatorsâ€™ earning potential from traditional Web 2 constraints by seamlessly connecting creators, their audiences, and communities around shared interests. League.Tech empowers everyone to enter and thrive in the creator economy.

Our platform isn't just another social network; it's the first social empowerment network, enabling its users in true social, economic, and governance terms. Our mission is clear: **to empower anyone to thrive in the creator economy.**

To achieve this, our platform provides participants with the tools they need to succeed. At League.Tech, we believe in putting control in the hands of our participants. With our multi-tiered access system, users have the freedom to tailor their online experience.

Our platform also provides an enhanced mechanism for price discovery through direct shorting on the bonding curve. Additionally, participants can showcase their skills and earn rewards by earning badges. \
