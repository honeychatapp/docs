# What is special about League.Tech?

### **Intro to SocialFi**

SocialFi represents a convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) principles with the dynamics of social media. This transformative concept aims to reshape the landscape of digital interactions by putting control, ownership, and monetization directly into the hands of content creators and their audience.

Operating on the premise of allowing users to monetize their interactions. Content creators can directly engage with their audience without intermediaries, marking a departure from the traditional social media model. Unique elements such as digital ownership through NFTs and DAOs for governance further enhance the experience.

Most SocialFi projects enable creators to capitalize on their content through social tokens attached to a bonding curve, with a percentage of fees going to the creator. Within League.Tech, these are referred to as Access Passes, providing full access to a creator's content.

### **How is League.Tech is Different?**

League.Tech has the requisite features and vision to meaningfully impact user growth beyond crypto natives. With a mission to **empower anyone to thrive in the creator economy.**

Our model creates a premium SocialFi experience, establishing pathways for both creators and fans to receive economic benefits for the growth of the creatorsâ€™ popularity and the strength of the community.

We empower participants by putting control in their hands through our multi-tiered access system. Our platform offers a better mechanism for price discovery through direct shorting on the bonding curve. Additionally, participants can showcase their skills and earn through their on-chain reputation, earning badges and clout. Leagues allow creators to schedule, monetize, and build vibrant online communities, complete with seasonal competitions for added engagement.
