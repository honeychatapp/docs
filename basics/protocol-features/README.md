# What is special about League.Tech?

### **Intro to SocialFi**

SocialFi represents a convergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) principles with the dynamics of social media. This transformative concept aims to reshape the landscape of digital interactions by putting control, ownership, and monetization directly into the hands of content creators and their audience.

Operating on the premise of allowing users to monetize their interactions. Content creators can directly engage with their audience without intermediaries, marking a departure from the traditional social media model. Unique elements such as digital ownership through NFTs and DAOs for governance further enhance the experience.

Most SocialFi projects enable creators to capitalize on their content through social tokens attached to a bonding curve, with a percentage of trading fees going to the creator. Within League.Tech, these are referred to as Access Passes, providing full access to a creator's content.
