# Shorting

In an effort to keep the platform accessible long-term, League.Tech is the first to bring an innovative shorting mechanism to SocialFi to avoid the continuously increasing “key” pricing seen on current competitor platforms. Users can engage in the shorting of social tokens, referred to as “access passes,” by taking speculative positions on the anticipated decrease in pass prices. This feature allows users to benefit from market dynamics even when predicting a decline in pass prices, providing a unique avenue for active participation within the League.Tech ecosystem. The introduction of shorting flips lucrative social media advertising on its head, creating a more balanced market where all participants can earn revenue from the success of the platform too.&#x20;
