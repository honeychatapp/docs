## Public Feed

Looks like X, could be X&#x20;

## Private Feed (Subscription)

Don't like the inconsistent pricing of Access Passes being traded? No problem! Private feeds offer a subscription model, providing a hassle-free way to support creators you love while gaining access to exclusive content and a more intimate community experience.

Subscription prices are initially set to free but can be manually adjusted by the content creator.

## Access Pass

_Access Passes are the core ownership item in Honey Chat_

Individuals purchase access passes tied to their chosen creators, unlocking exclusive privileges, gaining entry to private chat rooms, direct messaging, exclusive content, and additional perks established by each creator. Purchasing an access pass gives you full access, including access to all other tiers. &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for others to buy your Access Pass, you must buy at least one Pass from yourself. Once this action is complete, your pass can now be traded by anyone.&#x20;
