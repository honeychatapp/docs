With half of this fee being allocated directly to the future token.&#x20;

**Total Fee:** The cumulative effect of the platform fee, share owner fee, and referrer fee results in a 10% fee on all transactions within the League.Tech ecosystem. It's important to note that liquidation transactions, performed as a service for the platform, do not incur any fees for the liquidator.

### **Subscription Model:**

Subscriptions have a default length of 30 days

**Tipping Mechanism:** Tipping operates outside the smart contract, involving a simple Metis.transfer call. The transaction is then indexed in the League.Tech database, associating the transfer with a specific Post or Comment. While not governed by the smart contract, tipping enhances user engagement and content appreciation.
