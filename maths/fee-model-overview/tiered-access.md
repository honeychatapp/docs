# ⚖️ Tiered Access

## Public Feed

Available for anyone to see on the Honey Chat app.&#x20;

## Private Feed (Subscription)

Private feeds offer a subscription model, providing a hassle-free way to support creators, while gaining access to exclusive content and a more intimate community experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
Subscription prices are initially set to free but can be manually adjusted by the content creator.
{% endhint %}

## Access Pass

_Access Passes are the core ownership item in Honey Chat_

Individuals purchase access passes tied to their chosen creators, gaining entry to private chat rooms, direct messaging, exclusive content, and additional perks established by each creator. Purchasing an access pass gives you full access, including access to all other tiers. &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
To allow others to buy your Access Pass, you need to [create](../../how-to-guides/setup-your-chatroom.md) one first. Once created, your pass becomes tradable by anyone.
