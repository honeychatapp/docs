# üçØ Fee Model Overview

Honey Chat employs a transparent and flexible fee model to ensure fairness and sustainability within the ecosystem. The current fee structure is as follows:

## Access Pass Trading Fees:

* **Access Pass Owner Fee:** Pass owners, receive 5% of the total transaction amount. This incentivizes pass ownership and provides a direct benefit to the community members contributing to the platform's growth.
* **Referrer Fee:** Referrers receive between .5% - 1.5% of the transaction amount. This referral fee is designed to reward users who introduce new members to the Honey Chat community, fostering organic growth.
* **Platform Fee:** 3.5% - 4.5% of the transaction amount is directed to the platform. This fee contributes to the ongoing development and maintenance of Honey Chat, ensuring a robust and innovative social networking experience. With half of this fee being allocated directly to the future token.&#x20;

**Total Fee:** The cumulative effect of the platform fee, share owner fee, and referrer fee results in a 10% fee on all transactions within the Honey Chat ecosystem. It's important to note that liquidation transactions, performed as a service for the platform, do not incur any fees for the liquidator.

### Vesting

Upon a successful pass sale (buy/sell/short), 50% of the fee goes directly to the user whose pass is being transacted. The remaining 50% is stored in our Vesting contract where it is divided into 3 equal tranches. The first tranche vests at 30 days after the sale, the second after 60 days, and the third after 90 days.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You may choose to cash out early for a reduced amount of the vested fees. This mechanism is designed to encourage participants to remain engaged or committed over the full vesting period but provides an option for liquidity if needed.

## **Subscription Model:**

Subscriptions have a length of 30 days, and all prices are set by the Subscription Owner.&#x20;

* **Subscription Owner Fee:** 75% of the transaction amount is directed to the subscription owner.
* **Platform Fee:** 25% of the transaction amount is directed to the platform.&#x20;
